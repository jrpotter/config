[VERSION 1.0.0 - 06-13-2016]

I have played around with various different setups while programming and, inevitably, I end up accidentally deleting something 
I did not intend to delete. This is a listing of certain files I have accidentally deleted that I want to keep an active copy 
of for referencing when I end up deleting them again.

Included:
* Neovim
* Termite
* ZSH
* LaTeX (MathJax)
